## 2. Update Strategy
### Updates
An automated update should be done monthly and scheduled according to the Patch Tuesday (second tuesday of the month) and done at off hours to eliminate down time. The monthly update checklist includes:
- monthly Patch: apply the monthly Patch and if needed manual Patchs
- reboot: Ensure the machines restart to complete the installation
- monitor Backups: Be sure all automated backups are working properly
- check security: ensure an update of antivirus and firewall and review the settings
- free disk Space: clear temporary files to ensure enough space for updates and running

Use Windows Active hours to ensure the updates are not happening during work hours.

### Backups
critical data should be backed up daily at least or automatically upload changes to the cloud or server as it is changed. This way nothing is lost if anything happens. a disk image should be done about every 4 months, which does make a copy of everything.

### Why this strategy
Nothing is more annoying than having an update starting while you are trying to help a client or customer. Updates can take a lot of time and this long waiting time can cost a company customers. At the same time this Patches are important especially since some of the updates are security patches. Doing those off hours keeps the security up to date without slowing down business hours. Additional the updates and review of the Firewall and Antivirus helps the company to be up to date on the companies safety.
